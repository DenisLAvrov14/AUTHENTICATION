# AUTHENTICATION
 This project is a web application built with Vite and React using TypeScript, designed for user authentication and management. Leveraging Firebase as the backend, the app enables user registration, login, and allows authenticated users to manage other users' statuses (block/unblock, delete) through an interactive user table.
